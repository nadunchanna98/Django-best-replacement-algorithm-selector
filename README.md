# Django Best Replacement Algorithm Selector

https://github.com/nadunchanna98/Django-best-replacement-algorithm-selector/assets/108536998/e598eb31-44a7-4979-99da-9f19d613d709

## Problem Statement:

This Django project is designed to solve the following problem:

Given a reference string as input, the goal is to select the best replacement algorithm from the following set of algorithms:

1. First In First Out (FIFO)
2. Least Recently Used (LRU)
3. Least Frequently Used (LFU)
4. Most Frequently Used (MFU)

The selected algorithm will determine how items are replaced or evicted from a cache or memory structure based on the access patterns of the reference string.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Django environment if you haven't already.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the Django development server. "python manage.py runserver"
5. Access the web interface and input your reference string to determine the best replacement algorithm.

## Algorithms:

### 1. First In First Out (FIFO):

The FIFO algorithm replaces the oldest item in the cache when a new item needs to be stored.

### 2. Least Recently Used (LRU):

The LRU algorithm replaces the least recently accessed item in the cache when a new item needs to be stored.

### 3. Least Frequently Used (LFU):

The LFU algorithm replaces the least frequently accessed item in the cache when a new item needs to be stored.

### 4. Most Frequently Used (MFU):

The MFU algorithm replaces the most frequently accessed item in the cache when a new item needs to be stored.
